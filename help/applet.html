<h1>KstatBrowser Applet</h1>

<p>Kstatbrowser is a graphical utility to browse through and display the
various statistics kept by the Solaris kernel.</p>

<p>An individual kstat is identified by the triplet
module:instance:name, and each kstat has a number of individual
statistics and belongs to a particular class.</p>

<h2>The left panel</h2>

<p>The left panel contains three tabs which show a tree view of the
available kstats, ordered in different ways. Each node of the tree
follows the module:instance:name hierarchy.</p>

<ul>

<li>By Module - this is a straight tree ordered by module.</li>

<li>By Class - adds a top-level ordering by class, with the modules
underneath.</li>

<li>By Type - each kstat is of a given type, which determines how the
statistics are stored. With a KSTAT_TYPE_NAMED kstat, the statistics
are name-value pairs; with KSTAT_TYPE_IO they are in a fixed
format. The KSTAT_TYPE_RAW kstats have a private binary structure and
need decoding on a case-by-case basis.</li>

</ul>

<p>Selecting and expanding a node allows you to drill down through the 
kstat hierarchy. Then, selecting a leaf node will display the relevant
kstat.</p>

<h2>The right panel</h2>

<p>The right panel initially displays some statistics about the
available kstats - how many, and a breakdown by module, class, and
type.</p>

<p>Selecting a kstat will cause a table showing the names and values of
the available statistics to be displayed. The table will update
regularly and also show the rate of change of numeric statistics.</p>

<p>As each kstat of type KSTAT_TYPE_RAW needs to be decoded
individually, not all raw kstats will have data shown.</p>

<p>Some kstats will have a small graphical accessory. For example, as
all KSTAT_TYPE_IO kstats are of exactly the same form, and all measure
I/O, a simple panel showing the current I/O is shown.</p>

<p>In the table, if you right-click on a statistic that's a numeric
value, you can view a chart of that statistic as a function of
time.</p>

<h2>The toolbar</h2>

<p>The toolbar contains a small number of menus.</p>

<ul>

<li>Info - lets you get back to the statistics panel that is shown when
kstatbrowser starts.</li>

<li>Update every - allows you to set how rapidly the statistics are
updated.</li>

<li>Kstat Demos - allows you to launch some graphical demos of JKstat's
capabilities.</li>

<li>Help - shows this help file, and the CDDL license that this
software is licensed under.</li>

</ul>
