<p>Classes allowing the construction of a client that can retrieve
kstat data from a JKstat server.</p>

<p>A RemoteJKstat is a JKstat implementation that you can query for the
data. In normal use, this is the only class that's of interest. It can
simply be created using a URL to specify the server, or read its
configuration from a KClientConfig.</p>

<p>The JKStatClient class handles communication over the wire.</p>
