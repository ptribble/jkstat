Everything that calls ChartableKstat.update() should check the return
code

Can I lose the aggregate charts? And just pass a Chartable aggregate to
a regular chart instead?

No max age in area charts?

Add chartable support consistently to the charts.

CPU stat - color gradient the bars, like a flame.

Chartbuilder needs to understand chartable

Polish applet - polish the html page so it doesn't look quite so awful
(having a border round the app would help).

Batch remote: multiple requests, aka mget.

Multi-scaled charts (so each attribute has a different scale).

kstat cli should support remoting.

Demos should support kar format. (Maybe need a controller above
the demo with the control buttons.)

Fix the FIXMEs

For sequenced jkstats
=====================

Parseable code needs some level of error-checking.

Make the tables into accessories - so that we can drive them the same
way.

Add a flag to KstatTable to toggle rates, rather than guessing from
whether the interval is positive

Should regular JKstat be a singleton?
