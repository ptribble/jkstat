<p>Standard graphical user interface components for JKstat.</p>

<p>Accessories are little display widgets displaying a specific kstat
(or type of kstat). They all extend KstatAccessoryPanel, and
KstatAccessoryRegistry can be queried to see if an accessory exists for
a given kstat.</p>

<p>There is support for displaying kstat in tables, see
KstatTable. There are also some specific TabelModels to support iostat
and mpstat.</p>

<p>Other classes support the generation of charts, using <a
